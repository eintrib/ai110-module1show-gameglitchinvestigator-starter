# 💭 Reflection: Game Glitch Investigator

Answer each question in 3 to 5 sentences. Be specific and honest about what actually happened while you worked. This is about your process, not trying to sound perfect.

## 1. What was broken when you started?

- What did the game look like the first time you ran it?
- List at least two concrete bugs you noticed at the start  
  (for example: "the hints were backwards").

  - no matter the mode, the text it static and does not change. 
  - the enter button does not work to submit
  - even though the number is between 1 and 100, the guesser still said   higher when 100 was entered and lower when 1 was entered
  - 

**Bug Reproduction Log**

Document at least 3 bugs you found. Add rows as needed.

## 2. How did you use AI as a teammate?

- Which AI tools did you use on this project (for example: ChatGPT, Gemini, Copilot)?
- I used Claude and Gemini.

- Give one example of an AI suggestion that was correct (including what the AI suggested and how you verified the result).

- The AI suggested that the high/low hint string outputs were inverted. It suggested refractoring the check_guess function into logic_utils.py removing the broken code and replacing it with the correct logical operation. 

- Give one example of an AI suggestion that was incorrect or misleading (including what the AI suggested and how you verified the result).

- N/A

## 3. Debugging and testing your fixes

- How did you decide whether a bug was really fixed?

- I went through the code and the ran the app and walked through the specific fix I just made. 

- Describe at least one test you ran (manual or using pytest)  
  and what it showed you about your code.
  
- Did AI help you design or understand any tests? How?

## 4. What did you learn about Streamlit and state?

- How would you explain Streamlit "reruns" and session state to a friend who has never used Streamlit?

## 5. Looking ahead: your developer habits

- What is one habit or strategy from this project that you want to reuse in future labs or projects?
  - This could be a testing habit, a prompting strategy, or a way you used Git.
- What is one thing you would do differently next time you work with AI on a coding task?
- In one or two sentences, describe how this project changed the way you think about AI generated code.
